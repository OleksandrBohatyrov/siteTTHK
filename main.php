    <p>add any IT text</p>
    <p>Task 1. Use different HTML formats (10 pcs) and test the attached textile</p>
    <b>First generation programming languages are called machine code languages.</b>
    <br>
    <em> Machine code consists of commands that a computer (processor) can execute<br>( and the data associated with these commands).</em>
    <del>In machine code <mark>the programmer</mark> had to write his program in binary code so that it would be readable and executable by the processor.</del>
    <i>Essentially, such programming requires good knowledge and understanding of hardware, <b>because</b> during programming, one must know what the processor can do, where the input-output devices (I/O-Input-Output) are located and how to communicate with them and how long it takes for some activity.</i>
    <p>Thus, the machine code is very strongly related to the hardware on which the corresponding program will run <mark> Machine code</mark> is not modern.</p>
    <ins>Second generation programming languages are assembler languages</ins>

    <ul>
        <li>C - <b>the name comes from</b> that the language was largely based on a programming language called B, created for writing operating systems (many Unix-like operating systems are mostly written in C), for a long time one of the most popular programming languages. </li>
        <li>C++ - <sup> object-oriented C.</sup></li>
        <li>Java - a programming language developed on the basis of C++ </li>
        <li>C# - <i>all third generation programming languages</i></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Task 2. Add 3 different styles to different section elements</p>
